After some time, the workers who installed the drywall finished their work and it was time to install the second sensors, which were slightly different from the previous ones.

Let me remind you of the clamps:
1. Input +
2. Input -
3. Output -
4. Output +
5. Jumper (not used)
6. Light signaling - (fire alarm, since the first sensor is covered with plasterboard and is not visible, the indication is taken out of the room into the corridor)
7. Light signaling +

But the new sensors have only 4 main clamps as it is connected to the old ones
